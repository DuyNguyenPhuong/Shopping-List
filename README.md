When I traveled to Santorini, I was motivated to create a Mobile App to keep track of my to do list.

This is my Mobile App with me in Santorini in September 2022

Therefore I used Kotlin, along with TypeORM and Adapter to built this Mobile App

This App can help user save, delete, and edit lists on Mobile
